 * CloudflareReadonlyAdapter
 *
 * A Colony SDK IPFS adapter for Cloudflare IPFS (https://developers.cloudflare.com/web3/ipfs-gateway/). It only supports reading IPFS data from the Cloudflare gateway (not uploading or pinning files).
 *
 * This is the default IpfsAdapter used in Colony SDK. So in order to use this, you don't have to do anything.
