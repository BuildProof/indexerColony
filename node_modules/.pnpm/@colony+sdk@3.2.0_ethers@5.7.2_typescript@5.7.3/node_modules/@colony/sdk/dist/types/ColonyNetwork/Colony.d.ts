     * Execute an arbitrary transaction in the name of the Colony

     * This method can execute a transaction on any Ethereum Smart Contract with the Colony address as the sender. The action needs to be encoded function data (see https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/abi/interface/#Interface--encoding). We provide some common interfaces for you to make it even easier.
